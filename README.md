# Planets

## We have 8 planets in the solar system. All of these have different characteristics, including name, distance away from the sun, mass, etc.

## Here an enum is created, Planet, with 8/9 values representing the planets in the solar system.

## Each value includes the name of the planet, average distance from sun & mass.

## JUnit test code demonstrates the use of the enum.
